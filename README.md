# Open In Conversation

Thunderbird add-on to make the default message list action "Open Message in Conversation"

## How it Works

First, be sure you have message threading enabled (*View* > *Sort by* > *Threaded*). Then, right-click on a thread. Notice the option "Open Message in Conversation":

Basically, this add-on makes that the default action when you press "Enter" or double-click a message.

This works best when you don't have the "multi-pane" layout (i.e. you open messages in a new tab instead of viewing them in a pane).

The window that opens contains not only the messages in the thread that are in your inbox, but also ones in other folders (so you can see sent messages in there too).
